# ONS Treasury

This document describes how funds associated with the Onchain Name Service (ONS) protocol are handled during early development.

ONS is currently in an early-stage, founder-led phase. Treasury management is intentionally simple and transparent, with the goal of evolving toward increased decentralization over time.

## Purpose of the Treasury

Funds collected through ONS name registrations are used to:

- Maintain and improve core protocol contracts
- Fund infrastructure, tooling, and integrations
- Support ongoing development and maintenance
- Prepare for future upgrades, audits, and decentralization
- Sustain early contributors and founders building the protocol

---

## Early-Stage Custody Model (v1)

During ONS v1:

- Protocol revenue is received into a designated ONS protocol wallet
- Funds are managed manually by the protocol maintainer(s)
- No DAO, governance token, or on-chain treasury logic is active in v1
- No guarantees are made regarding perpetual ownership or revenue distribution

This model is standard for early protocols and allows rapid iteration while the system matures.

---

## Founder Compensation

ONS is actively developed and maintained. As such:

- A portion of protocol revenue may be used for founder compensation
- Compensation reflects time, risk, and ongoing work required to build and operate the protocol
- Remaining funds are retained for protocol operations and future development

Exact allocations may evolve over time as the protocol matures.

---

## Transparency & Future Evolution

ONS is designed to evolve.

Planned future improvements may include:
- Multi-signature treasury custody
- Community or contributor governance
- On-chain treasury controls
- Token-based coordination mechanisms

Any transition to a more decentralized treasury model will be communicated publicly and documented in advance.

## Non-Custodial Nature

ONS does not custody user funds beyond protocol-level registration fees.
Users retain full control of their registered names and associated records according to protocol rules.

## Disclaimer

ONS is experimental software.
Participation is voluntary and at the user’s own risk.
