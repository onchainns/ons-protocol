# ons-protocol

Onchain Name Service (ONS) is an open protocol for registering and resolving human-readable onchain names.

ONS is designed as a neutral, chain-agnostic naming layer that can be integrated by wallets, applications, and protocols across ecosystems.

This repository contains the core protocol contracts, specifications, and reference implementations.

## Goals

- Simple, human-readable onchain identifiers  
- Chain-agnostic by design  
- Open and permissionless protocol  
- Minimal assumptions about wallets or frontends  
- Composable with existing onchain infrastructure  

## Scope

The ONS protocol focuses on:
- Name registration and ownership
- Onchain resolution primitives
- Extensible records for future use cases

UI, indexing, and third-party integrations are intentionally kept out of the core protocol.

## Status

This project is in early development.

Specifications and implementations are subject to change as the protocol evolves.
